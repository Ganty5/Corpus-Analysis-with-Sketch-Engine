## Overview
This project applies **corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to Chinua Achebe’s novel *Things Fall Apart*.  
Using **Sketch Engine**, I and my team built a literary corpus to explore how language reflects cultural traditions, spirituality, and the early impacts of colonialism.  

The project demonstrates how corpus analysis can uncover **patterns, themes, and hidden structures** in long texts, and how similar methods can be applied in business contexts (e.g., consumer insights, survey analysis, customer reviews).

## Why This Project
Literary texts like *Things Fall Apart* are rich in cultural and linguistic layers.  
Instead of reading page by page, we wanted to see what happens when you let **data and algorithms** guide the discovery process.  

Questions we asked included:  
- What cultural concepts appear most often in the novel?  
- How do references to community, tradition, or spirituality shift when colonial themes enter the text?  
- Can quantitative analysis of words and collocations highlight deeper narrative patterns?

## Dataset
- **Novel**: *Things Fall Apart* (Chinua Achebe, 1958)  
- Loaded into **Sketch Engine** as a full text corpus.  
- Processed to allow keyword extraction, wordlists, collocation analysis, and comparative word sketches.

## Methodology
1. **Keyword Extraction**  
   - Identified statistically significant words compared to a reference corpus.  
   - Helped highlight culturally unique vocabulary (*yam, egwugwu, chi*).

2. **Wordlists**  
   - Ranked words by frequency across chapters.  
   - Gave an overview of dominant themes (*harvest, spirits, elders*).

3. **Word Sketch & Collocations**  
   - Examined how important words co-occur in sentences.  
   - Example: *yam* linked to *harvest, wealth, manhood*.

4. **Word Sketch Difference**  
   - Compared usage patterns of cultural vs. colonial terms.  
   - Revealed linguistic tension between tradition and colonial structures (e.g., *spirit vs. church*, *elders vs. government*).

## Results
- **Cultural Themes**: Clear clusters around harvest cycles, spirituality, and family hierarchy.  
- **Colonial Influence**: Shifts in collocations show how words like *church* or *government* replaced or reframed traditional concepts.  
- **Practical Insight**: Demonstrated how corpus methods can quickly surface **patterns that a manual reader might miss**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Sketch Engine** for corpus analysis and keyword extraction  
- **Excel** for exporting results and clustering patterns  
- **Python** (basic preprocessing and validation of the raw text)

## Applications
While this study was literary, the same methods apply to:  
- **Consumer & Market Insights**: Mining reviews or surveys for recurring themes.  
- **Brand & Media Analysis**: Tracking how consumers talk about products or campaigns.  
- **Cultural Analytics**: Exploring how language reflects identity, values, and change.
